 The NameSayer application allows users to practice pronouncing names from the given database of names. The user can pick which name they want to practice of the database, listen to the recording, and record themselves saying the name.
To run this application:

Open terminal and locate the directory NameSayer is located in
Run the command "java -jar NameSayer.jar”.

or

Simply double click the jar file to launch the application.


Once the application is open, the user will be presented with the menu screen. From here, users can choose to start a new practice, upload a file, test their microphone or quit the application.

Practice:
After clicking the new practice button, the user will be brought to a selection screen where they can select which names they want to practice from the database.  If users want to practice a composite name consisting of one or more names from the database, the user can simply type in the full name they wish to practice and the app will automatically create an audio clip of the composite name. Users also have the option of randomizing the order in which they wish to practice the names.

After name selection, the user will be brought to the main workspace, where they have the option of playing database versions of their chosen names or their personal attempts at those names. Users also have the option of recording a new personal recording for that name. 

A ‘rate’ button allows users to rate the quality of current database recording. Recordings with low ratings will have ‘bad quality’ warning to warn users.

Upload file:
This application gives users the option of uploading a text file with a list of names they wish to practice. The application will automatically find the listed names in the database and create a play queue for the user.

Test microphone:
The test microphone button leads the user to a testing screen. Here, users can test their microphone against a microphone level bar to ensure their microphone is working.

Special features:
A special feature of this application is the volume slider in the workspace. This allows the user to adjust the volume of the recording to their liking.
Another special feature is the reward system, which shows the user a congratulatory alert after 5 and 10 recordings.
